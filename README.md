💥 Rapture Collapse
Priority Chaos Terminal
A brutal productivity weapon that scrambles your task priorities at random intervals. Survive the chaos or watch your system COLLAPSE. 😈

✨ Features
Mode	Interval	Math Difficulty	Chaos Level
NORMAL	45s	Basic (+, -)	😊
ADVENTURE	30s	Medium (×, ÷, ())	⚔️
HELL	10s	Complex multi-step + traps	🔥💀
Core Mechanics:
✅ Dynamic Priority Shuffling - Tasks reorder randomly

🧮 Math Authentication - Solve to pause chaos (12s timer)

💥 SYSTEM COLLAPSE - Wrong answer at 1s speed = TOTAL DESTRUCTION

🎮 3 Difficulty Tiers - Progressive suffering

🌊 Screen shake + glitch effects on collapse
